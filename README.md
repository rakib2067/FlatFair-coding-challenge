# FlatFair-coding-challenge

## Installation & Usage

### Technologies

- `TypeScript`
- `NodeJS`
- `Jest`

### Installation

- Clone or download the repo
- Open terminal and run `npm install`

### Usage

- run `npm test` to run all tests
- From root directory, run `tsc` or if not globally installed, `npm run build` to compile typescript code

## Process

- Created function and model with specified types and return types
- Created a tree for organisation structure using Classes
- Added insert and get branch methods to `OrganisationStructure`
- Completed the functionality for `calculateMembershipFee`
- Added test cases

## Shortcomings/Limitations

- Current data model and insertion is limited to the structure of the test array of organisation units
  - Potenital future tweaks to make it more flexible/mealleable
